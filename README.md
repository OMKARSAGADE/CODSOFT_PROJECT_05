Student Management System (Java GUI)

Overview
The Student Management System is a Java-based application designed to manage a collection of student records. It allows users to add new students, remove students, search for existing students, and display all student records. The application is equipped with a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) built using JavaFX or Swing. Additionally, the system supports storing student data in a file or a database for persistent storage.

The system includes input validation to ensure that fields are filled correctly and that the student data is accurate. The project demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in Java and focuses on data management and GUI development.

Features
Student Management: Add, remove, search, and display student information.
Student Attributes: Each student record contains attributes such as name, roll number, grade, and other relevant details.
GUI Interface: A clean, interactive interface using JavaFX (or Swing) to perform operations such as adding new students, editing existing records, and searching.
Persistent Storage: Read and write student data to a file or a database.
Input Validation: Ensures that all required fields are correctly filled, and that data is in the appropriate format (e.g., grades, roll numbers).
Student Search: Allows users to search for students by name or roll number.

Technologies Used
Java: Core programming language.
JavaFX or Swing: Framework for building the GUI.
VS Code: Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used for development.
File/Database Storage: Supports writing student data to files (e.g., text files) or databases (e.g., SQLite, MySQL).
Input Validation: Ensures correct data formats (e.g., number for roll numbers, valid grades).
